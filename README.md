## Glucose level prediction
The objective of this research is to leverage blood glucose and related time-series data from the OhioT1DM dataset to detect key patient activities, including meals, insulin administration, physical activity, and other treatment-related events. By evaluating impacts of these activities on blood glucose levels and overall health, this study aims to uncover change patterns between dynamic event attributes and activities.
## Dataset : 
OhioT1DM dataset
## Glucose Predictions:
Develop personalized models to forecast glucose levels for individual patients, helping them optimize daily habits and improve their overall lifestyle.
